# RailroadSwitch
Hobby Railroad Switch

This small project is my first steps in ESP8266 programming. The idea is a hobby railroad switch that can be controlled by a mobile phone. The controller is an ESP8266 WiFi enabled chip integrated into NodeMCU or WeMos D1 platform. The software is developed by the Arduino IDE.

The device shall fulfill the following requirements:

- It shall be able to provide configuration interface.
- It shall be able to provide to show the actual state of the device.
- It shall be able to control the railroad switch via wireless connection.
- It shall provide outputs to a railroad switch with 12 V.
