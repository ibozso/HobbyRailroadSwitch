# RailroadSwitch
Hobby Railroad Switch

This small project is my first steps in ESP8266 programming. The idea is a hobby railroad switch that can be controlled by a mobile phone. The controller is an ESP8266 WiFi enabled chip integrated into NodeMCU or WeMos D1 platform. The software is developed by the Arduino IDE.
